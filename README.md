## Welcome to Robert's Learning Journal

#### Hi! My name is Robert and I am taking Code 102 with Code Fellows. I plan to take these courses through Code 401 for the purpose of pursuing a career in cybersecurity. I'm glad to meet you all and I hope to see you in future classes. If you want to know more about me, here's a link to my GitHub [profile page](https://github.com/racarter1215).
