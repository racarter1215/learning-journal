## Version Control

#### -This allows one to go back to earlier versions of a file to see the full record of changes. You can even revert back to an eariler file if you wish.

#### -Centralized Version Control has a single server storing all file versions, including all changes. This allows those collaborating on a project to understand changes made by others in real time.

#### -Distributed Version Contol systems solve the issue of having a single server, which is suseptible to failure. This makes 'mirrored repositories', which allow for the sum total work on a file to be saved even if one or multiple servers or computers go down. 

## What is Git?

#### It's a DVCS that stores snapshots of a file in a file system. For every commit, Git makes a snapshot so you can reference it again. 

#### Git relies on local operations for expediency's sake. It also traks changes so you can prevent the loss of data or your place during building/editing files. Git also exists in several states, including committed, modified, and staged.
