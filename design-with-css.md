## Introducing CSS

#### CSS is designed for you to style HTML text. 
#### Each part of an html text document is divided into blocks, which can constitute entire paragraphs, headers, and articles, or as little as a word or two within a text box that are to be modified in some way.

#### Basic eleemtns of CSS are the selector (part of html to modify) and delclaration (what the modificaiton is)
#### Each declaration is separted into the property (what specifically is being modified) and value (what the modification actually is)
