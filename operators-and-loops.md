## Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions

#### == means is equal to, means operator compares two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are the same.

#### != means is not equal to, also compares two values to see if they are the same.

#### === means strict equal to, compares two values to check that BOTH the data type and value are the same.

#### !== strict not equal to means the operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are NOT the same

#### > means the operator checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right

#### < means the operator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right

#### >= means greater than or equal to

#### <= means less than or equal to

## Logical Operators

#### These allow you to compare the rusults of more than one comparison operator.

#### Example: ((5 < 2) && (2 >= 3)). The double ampersand in the middle is the logical operator checking both things

#### && means logical and. This operator tests more than one condition

#### || means logical or. the operator tests at least one condition.

#### ! means logical not. the opertor takes a single Boolean value and inverts it. Example !(2 < 1) would be true

## Loops

#### Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be check again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. There are three common types of loops:
###### For. This is for running code a specific number of times. Example: for(var i = 0' i < 10; i++)
###### While. If you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a while loop.
###### Do While. The do...while loop is very similar to while lop, but is different by always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the ocndition evaluates to false.

## Loop Counters

#### Consists of initialization, condition, and update
