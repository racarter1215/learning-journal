## How Computers Work

#### 4 Parts: Input, Output, CPU, and Memory

#### Software controls Hardware

#### Computers are everywhere, even if the thing we are using makes it not apparent.

#### We use computers to help us with thinking work, similar to how tools throughout history have helped us with manual work.

#### Computers need to have input, storage, processing, and output capacity to truly be a computer

#### Early computers made out of wood and metal, now we have electrical components. 

#### Input: the stuff that the world does that makes the computer do stuff

#### Processors take info from memory and changes them via algorithms and sends them back to be stored again

#### Output is varied by what the computer is designed to do. Could range from controlling robots to manipulating your video game character

## Binary and Data

#### Inside computers are electric wires and circuits that store all info in computers.

#### Signals are either on or off, one wire can be yes or no. 1 or zero. On/off state of wire is a bit. More wires, more bits, more complex info

#### with 8 wires you can store numbers between 0 and 855

#### you can represent text, images, and sound with numbers

## Circuits and Logic

#### Circuitry is an artform. Computers use millions of tiny components to make circuits

#### if you give signal a 1, circuit gives you 0. vice versa. we call this circuit not

#### circuits only give you a 1 if both first and second signals are 1. this is called an 'and'

#### adders compute the sum

#### smaller circuits mean less distance for electricity to go, hence faster.

## CPU, Memory, Input, Output

#### input devices take info from world and convert to binary, memory stores it, CPU makes calculations, and output converts it to physical output.

#### computers take input from keyboard, touch, gps, etc.

#### memory stores such information

#### CPU computes

#### output translates it for human consumption

#### multiple cpus are needed in modern computers to process all the information it recieves.
