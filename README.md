## Welcome to GitHub Pages

### We made changes

##### Growth Mindset is to understand that you start the process of learning something new by first concluding that you do not yet understand it, but will if you persevere. It means seeking help and resources while applying it during individual activities. It also means you will fail a lot before you succeed, and that failing is the path to success.

Reminder 1.) Remember that you started this process knowing literally nothing about the subject. Reflect on what you know now.

Reminder 2.) Seek help from others, but do not rely on it. Trust yourself to learn through application.

Reminder 3.) Always seek new challenges. These will sharpen learned skills.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/racarter1215/learning-journal/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/racarter1215/learning-journal/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
