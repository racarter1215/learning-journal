## JavaScript uses

#### It can allow access to content, modify content, program rules, such as make calculations from user provided data, and react to events, such as a button on the website being pressed by a user.

#### Examples of JS in browser: SLideshows, forms, reload part of page, filerting data

## Scripts

#### Scripts are a series of instructions that  a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

#### Very similar to recipies or manuals in the physical world

#### To write script, you need to break it down to small tasks, then build to the larger picture.
###### Define the goal
###### Design the script (do this by splitting tasks into flowchart or something like that)
###### Code each step

### Tasks

#### Flowchart: tasks of a hotel cleaner (page 18 of JS book)

### Example: Steps required to tidy a romm (list view)
###### Remove used bedding
###### Wipe all surfaces
###### Vacuum floors
###### Fit new bedding
###### Remove used towels and soaps
###### Clean toilet, bath, sink, surfaces
###### Place new towels and soaps
###### Wipe bathroom floor

#### You need to know the vocabulary and syntax of code in order to tell JavaScript to run tasks on a webpage.

#### You also need to "think like a computer" and understand that you have to be very specific on what you want and when to avoid bugs, loops, or other ways of code failure.

##### This is called "programmatic" approach to problem solving
