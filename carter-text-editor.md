### Choosing a text editor:

#### Text Editors come in a variety of types, from free downloads or exclusive content on a particular computer (PC, MAC) to those that cost money via subscription that are available for all platorms. The most important thing to consider when selecting a text editor is the following:

###### 1. Code completion (allows you to auto-fill codes through a variety of prompts)
###### 2. Syntax Highlighting (allows one to identify particular strings of code by type via different colors)
###### 3. Theme variety (for ease of use by the coder)
###### 4. Availability of Extentions (to help you when you require additional tools or features, but not enough to warrant a new text editor)

### Proprietary Text Editors:

### Third Party Editors:
