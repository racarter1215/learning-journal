# HTML

#### Web pages often act like electronic newspapers, forms, and menus. 

#### Structure is key to this concept. For interaction and consumption by people, articles, both in print and on websites, must be structured with accessibility in mind. This includes breaking up paragraphs with sub-sections, font differentiations, and even color to help guide the user through the medium.

## HTML Describes the Structure of the Page

#### HTML code is expressed inside angled brackets and they form "elements"

#### Common elements are "<body></body>", <nav></nav>, etc." These open and close elements are called "tags"

#### All HTML code exists between tags, from <html></html> to <p></p>

#### Attributes tell us more info about eontents of an element. They are on the opening tag of the element and are made up of a "name" and a "value", separated by an equals sign. Example: <p lang="en-us".Paragraph in English</p>

#### The body is a large scale element in which many other elements typically go. The head is usually just under that, and has 6 levels (h1-h6). The Title is what is displayed on the website tab on the browser.

## Create Webpage

#### For PC users, you can create a webpage by using "Notepad", which comes with Microsoft Windows.

#### After typing in the html basic skeleton, save the file as whatever you wish it to be called, followed by .html. Go back to the file and open it, and it should take you to your new webpage. You can update it with whatever you wish.

#### Writing code in a content management system is usually constrained by the tools and extentions native to the content manager. The plus side of this is that people who aren't good at website creation will find this easier than more robust but confusing text editors.
