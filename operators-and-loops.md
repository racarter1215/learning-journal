## Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions

#### == means is equal to, means operator compares two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are the same.

#### != means is not equal to, also compares two values to see if they are the same.

#### === means strict equal to, compares two values to check that BOTH the data type and value are the same.

#### !== strict not equal to means the operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are NOT the same

#### > means the operator checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right

#### < means the operator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right

#### >= means greater than or equal to

#### <= means less than or equal to

## Logical Operators

#### These allow you to compare the rusults of more than one comparison operator.

#### Example: ((5 < 2) && (2 >= 3)). The double ampersand in the middle is the logical operator checking both things

#### && means logical and. This operator tests more than one condition

#### || means logical or. the operator tests at least one condition.

#### ! means logical not. the opertor takes a single Boolean value and inverts it. Example !(2 < 1) would be true
