## Welcome to GitHub Pages

### We made changes

Hi! My name is Robert and I am taking Code 102 with Code Fellows. I plan to take these courses through Code 401 for the purpose of pursuing a career in cybersecurity. I'm glad to meet you all and I hope to see you in future classes. If you want to know more about me, here's a link to my GitHub [profile page](https://github.com/racarter1215). 

##### **Growth Mindset** is to understand that you start the process of learning something new by first concluding that you do not yet understand it, but will if you persevere. It means seeking help and resources while applying it during individual activities. It also means you will fail a lot before you succeed, and that failing is the path to success.

  1. Remember that _you started this process knowing nothing_ about the subject. Reflect on what you know now.

  2. Seek help from others, but _do not rely completely on it_. Trust yourself to learn through application.

  3. Always seek new challenges. These will _sharpen learned skills_.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/racarter1215/learning-journal/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/racarter1215/learning-journal/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
