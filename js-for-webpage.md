## JavaScript Uses

#### It fits with HTML and CSS by allowing users to interact with webpages through a variety of means, including drop down menus, scrolling through images, etc.

#### This allows for more dynamic use of webpages by both the web designer and end user.

## Basic JavaScript

#### Parts of a script include an object, member operator, the method (which includes parameters)

#### It runs where you place it in HTML, including in the header, body, articles, etc. Be very careful where you place it as if you do it wrong the script won't run

#### Statements are individual instructions. Curly braces contain code blocks, which denote the information JS needs to understand what function you want it to perform.

#### It's good practice to write comments to explain what your code does, for your benefit and other developers

#### Variables are information bits that you need to tell JS in order for it to function. These includes things such as color, width, height, area, etc. They can be calculated or computed.

#### Variables include the variable keyword, variable name, assignment operator, and variable value

## Data Types

#### Numeric data types are numbers 0-9, with compound numbers not having ',' in them. Ex: 35467

#### String data type is data within " ' ' " Example: 'Hello'

#### Boolean is true or false data
