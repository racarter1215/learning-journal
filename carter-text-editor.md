# Carter Text Editor

## Notes 2-3-2020

### Choosing a text editor:

#### Text Editors come in a variety of types, from free downloads or exclusive content on a particular computer (PC, MAC) to those that cost money via subscription that are available for all platorms. The most important thing to consider when selecting a text editor is the following:

###### 1. Code completion (allows you to auto-fill codes through a variety of prompts)
###### 2. Syntax Highlighting (allows one to identify particular strings of code by type via different colors)
###### 3. Theme variety (for ease of use by the coder)
###### 4. Availability of Extentions (to help you when you require additional tools or features, but not enough to warrant a new text editor)

### Proprietary Text Editors:

#### These text editors are either already found on your computer or are availble for use only by the brand you have (Windows, MAC). They generally have what one would require, like Notepad++, but lack the availble extentions that make them lasting choices sometimes.

#### Such text editors include:

###### 1. Notepad
###### 2. Text Edit

### Third Party Editors:

#### These generally require one to spend a one time purchase fee or buy a subscription, but generally have greater levels of access to not on ly the 4 core funcitonalities listed above, but specifically extentions that extend the lifecycle of a text editor. It is up to the code writer if they require the additional (or at least different) capabilities.

#### Such text editors include:

###### 1. Notepad ++
###### 2. BB Edit
###### 3. Visual Studio Code
###### 4. Atom
###### 5. Brackets
###### 6. Sublime Text

### Text Editors and IDEs:

#### Basically, the difference is IDEs are text editors with a variety of other funcitons, such as file manager, debugger, and a compiler. As I am brand new to this discipline, I don't need an IDE yet, nor will I require one unless the job or project demands it.

### The Command Line:

#### In essence, its a system interface completely through text via special codes or prompts. It allows someone to go through the directory of a computer with lots of files very quickly without using the mouse. Generally, it's just a more efficient way of interacting with one's computer.
